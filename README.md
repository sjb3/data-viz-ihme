# Data Visualization Coding Challenge - Instructions

## Objective
Create a data visualization that helps answer the question, **“What population is most affected by opioid use disorders?”**  

You can choose either option to answer the question above. Either approach that you use (Option 1 or 2) will be weighted equally when your exercise is reviewed:  

**Option 1:** Create your own project from scratch, or  
**Option 2:** Use the project scaffolding provided in this repository as a starting point. If you choose to use the project scaffolding, you may modify any of the files provided as you see fit. See [Option 2: Software Requirements](#option-2-software-requirements) for more details.

Your application should include some interactivity for the user. We leave it to you to decide how best to visualize the data.

You may use any libraries or frameworks you find helpful. Here are a few suggestions for data visualization libraries:
- [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite)
- [Plotly.js](https://plot.ly/javascript)
- [D3](https://d3js.org/)
- [Victory](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/victory)
- [React-vis](https://github.com/uber/react-vis)
- [Semiotic](https://semiotic.nteract.io/)
- [Highcharts](https://github.com/highcharts/highcharts)

## What we're looking for

- **Understanding of code and adherence to best practices:** Is the code structured in a way that makes it easy to read and maintain? This is your opportunity to display your understanding and skill with the JavaScript language and with program design.
- **Visual understanding:** Is the data being presented in a way that is visually meaningful? Does it answer the question posed above?
- **Visual appeal:** Do the visual elements add to the story or detract from it?  

## Once you're done

1. Make the source code available on GitHub.
1. Host the final visualization on GitHub Pages, Heroku, or some other free hosting service.
1. Send us links to both the source code repository and the live deployment.   

### Option 2: Software Requirements <a name="option-2-software-requirements"></a>
You can modify any of the files provided in this repository, or choose to only use some of them.  
If you are using the project scaffolding provided for Option 2, you will need a recent version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org).

##### Installing dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

##### Running the server

Run the Node HTTP server, optionally specifying a port (default: 8080):

```bash
npm run serve [port]
```

##### Viewing the application locally

In a web browser, navigate to `http://localhost:[port]`, substituting for `[port]` the port number specified when running the server (default: 8080).

##### Browser compatibility

The project scaffolding uses modern JavaScript features. It should work as expected in modern browsers (tested in current versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Opera), but it may not work in Internet Explorer, Edge, and older browser versions.
